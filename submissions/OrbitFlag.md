Orbit Flag

## Project Description    
Orbit Flag is a modern, team-based feature flag management platform built with Next.js 15 and Appwrite, designed to give development teams fine-grained control over feature rollouts and experimentation.

## Inspiration behind the Project

This is built using NextJS, Tailwind, and Appwrite.
