## Project Title
Orbit Flag

## Project Description    
Orbit Flag is a free, fully open-source feature flagging system designed for developers who need maximum control.

Manage your deployments with precision through progressive rollouts and highly specific targeting. Define your audience based on context, allowing you to target anything from individual user names to entire countries.

Key capabilities include granular permissions for team-level access control, cascading conditions for complex logic, and the ability to define custom variations for A/B testing or personalized experiences.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
My search for a feature flagging product was constantly frustrated by a lack of options that offered the crucial trifecta: open-source code, a free price point, and professional-grade reliability.

## Tech Stack    
This is built using NextJS, Tailwind, and Appwrite.
